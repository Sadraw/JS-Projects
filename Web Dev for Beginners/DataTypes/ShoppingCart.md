# Imagine you are building a shopping cart. Write some documentation on the data types that you would need to complete your shopping experience. How did you arrive at your choices?


To build a shopping cart, we need to consider the different types of data we will be dealing with in our application. Here are the data types that we will need:

### Product:
A product is the primary entity that a user will be adding to the shopping cart. The product data type should include attributes such as name, description, price, and image. It may also include other properties like brand, color, size, etc.

### Cart Item:
A cart item represents a single instance of a product added to the shopping cart. It should include the product data as well as the quantity of the product added to the cart.

### Cart:
The cart is a collection of cart items that a user has added to their shopping cart. The cart should include the total cost of all the items in the cart, as well as any relevant taxes, discounts, or shipping costs.

### User:
The user is the person who is using the shopping cart. The user data type should include attributes such as name, email, address, and payment information. It may also include other properties like order history, wishlists, and saved payment methods.

### Order:
An order is a record of a completed transaction. It includes information such as the user who placed the order, the items that were purchased, the total cost, and the shipping information. An order may also include information about the payment method used and any applicable discounts or promotions.

I arrived at these data types by considering the essential features of a typical shopping cart application. A product is the central entity that a user adds to their cart. A cart item is a specific instance of a product that has been added to the cart. The cart is the collection of all the items a user has added to their cart. A user is the person who is using the shopping cart, and an order is a record of a completed transaction. By including these data types, we can build a robust and functional shopping cart application that can handle all the necessary operations.
